Work experience
======
**STMicroelectronics ‑ ADG R&D ‑ AI for Modeling and Predictive Reliability Team - Catania, Italy**

**Data Scientist Intern from April 2022 to October 2022**
+ Developed data science tools and deep learning models for:
  - Python implementation of MOSFET Level 3 SPICE, achieving faster computation performance than enterprise tools for a preparatory analysis on device modeling.
  - Wafer Parametric Comparison Analysis Tool, the introduction of Boosting and EDA techniques on T84 and EWS data suggested the selection of only 15 over 60 electrical tests speeding up the analysis by four times.
  - Defect detection on high‑resolution images of power modules in less than 5 seconds by innovatively applying YOLO algorithm (Patent
pending in US).

**Data Scientist Intern (Master's Degree Thesis) from September 2021 to January 2022**
+ Developed an end‑to‑end deep learning web‑application for Defect Pattern Recognition on Wafer Maps by reducing daily failure analysis time from hours to less than 15 minutes (Patent pending in US - [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9877886)). The pipeline consists in:
  - Unsupervised learning approach: applied Dimensionality Reduction and Hierarhical Clustering techniques to group new unknown defect patterns from production lines and then used as new labeled class to re‑train the CNN in supervised fashion.
  - Supervised learning approach: developed a CNN that achieved 96% of accuracy on 45 known patterns and benchmarked against State‑Of‑The‑Art (VGG‑19, ResNet‑152, DenseNet‑161 and Vision Transformer both pre‑trained on ImageNet or trained from scratch), performance assessed by applying Explainable AI (XAI) methods (Integrated Gradients, Grad‑CAM and Attention Maps).
