Work experience
======
**STMicroelectronics ‑ ADG R&D ‑ AI for Modeling and Predictive Reliability Team - Catania, Italy**

**Process Control Engineer - From January 2024**
+ NDA

**Advanced Research Engineer Intern - From April 2022 to October 2022**
+ Implemented SPICE MOSFET Level 3 on Python for device modeling and reverse engineered the static curve with Expansion‑Contraction Neural Network to extract model parameters lowering the error below <2%.
+ Developed the Wafer Parametric Comparison Analysis Tool, incorporating Boosting and EDA techniques on T84 and EWS data; streamlined analysis by 4x, narrowing down electrical tests from 60 to 15, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.
+ Designed and coded Defect Detector for Power Modules which analyzed high resolution microscopy images in less than 5 seconds by innovatively applying YOLO algorithm (**Patent pending in US and China**).


**Advanced Research Engineer Intern (Master's Degree Thesis) from September 2021 to January 2022**
+ Engineered a Defect Pattern Recognition Tool to reduce daily failure Wafer Maps analysis time from hours to less than 15 minutes (**Patent pending in US**) by combining:
  - Hierarchical Clustering techniques to group new unknown defect patterns with a similarity index of 94%;
  - Traditional CNN that achieved 96% of accuracy on 45 known patterns, benchmarked against SOTA and assessed XAI methods.
