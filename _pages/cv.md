Work experience
======
**[STMicroelectronics](https://www.st.com/)**
+ **Process Control Engineer** (Present)
  - NDA

+ **Advanced Research Engineer Intern** (April 2022 - October 2022)
  - Implemented SPICE MOSFET Level 3 on Python for device modeling and reverse engineered the static curve with Expansion‑Contraction Neural Network to extract model parameters lowering the error below <2%.
  - Developed the Wafer Parametric Comparison Analysis Tool, incorporating Boosting and EDA techniques on T84 and EWS data; streamlined analysis by 4x, narrowing down electrical tests from 60 to 15, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.
  - Designed and coded Defect Detector for Power Modules which analyzed high resolution microscopy images in less than 5 seconds by innovatively applying YOLO algorithm (**Patent pending in US**).


+ **Advanced Research Engineer Intern (Master's Degree Thesis)** (September 2021 - January 2022)
  - Engineered a Defect Pattern Recognition Tool to reduce daily failure Wafer Maps analysis time from hours to less than 15 minutes (**Patent pending in US**) by combining:
    * Hierarchical Clustering techniques to group new unknown defect patterns with a similarity index of 94%;
    * Traditional CNN that achieved 96% of accuracy on 45 known patterns, benchmarked against SOTA and assessed XAI methods.
