Two weeks ago I attended the International Computer Vision Summer School (ICVSS), a nice summer school full of lectures held by Machine and Deep Learning giants (e.g., Andrej Karpathy, William T. Freeman, and so on). 
Although the summer school content was interesting, I have also attended an essay competition about Human-imitative intelligence, i.e., if the current AI products can be considered an incarnation of human-intelligence or just a simulation.

In the essay, which was a collaboration between other three people coming from Zurich, Toronto and Luxemburg, we wrote about historical and current perspective of AI products with Turing Test in mind.
Check the essay [**HERE**](ICVSS_2023_Essay_Competition.pdf) and tell me what you think about!

PS: Sadly, we did not win but were awarded for Honourable mention
