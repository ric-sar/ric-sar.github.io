*Segmentation and Pose estimation on YOLOv8 demonstration at SHARPER Night 2023*

**SHARPER** (**SHA**ring **R**esearchers’ **P**assion for **E**nhanced **R**oadmaps) Night, the night of European researchers, was held on 29 September 2023. A disclosure event where the majority of Italian and European universities, united by scientific dissemination, showed the public some of the research carried out in the departments or simply informative works in order to highlight local scientific research activities.

Although I may not be a perfect entertainer and not a great crowd-pleaser, I participated together with other PhD students in this event. I put into practice the simplest communication techniques known to me to try to attract and explain to a non-specialist audience some problems or tasks that artificial intelligence can solve.

With not much surprise, I noticed how human beings are always attracted not only to themselves reflected on a monitor but also to what they don't know about, with at times a mixture of disappointment and fear.

Specifically, we had a workstation with 4 monitors where we showed in rotation:
* [XrayGPT](https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/XrayGPT): GPT applied to Xray, with the capability to have a conversation with an AI agent acting as a doctor;
* [Stable Diffuson](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui): diffusion models capable to generate images by text prompting;
* [MIDGARD](https://midgardsim.org/): an open-source simulatior for autonomous robot navigation in outdoor unstructured environments;
* [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics): an object detection and tracking, instance segmentation, image classification and pose estimation architecture.

It goes without saying that the segmentation activities combined with the pose estimation activities greatly attracted the public, who tried to understand what it was really used for. And in fact, let's not forget a fundamental point, research activity must always serve something (or someone ça va sans dire). A little awkwardly and with a bit of freestyle at the end, we managed to explain something to the audience, including older people. An age that brought with them wisdom, wisdom in explaining without mincing words that "If you continue like this, you will end up not working", highlighting the social conflict between capital and work worthy of a communism that no longer exists.

Ultimately it was fun, maybe the 7 hours on your feet wouldn't have been fun, even with a not very recommendable audience wandering around the tables and stands curiously. But in the end you have to start from somewhere to begin a work of dissemination...

Of course if you are one of the guy interested in research and AI in general, I created [THIS REPO](https://github.com/ric-sar/sharpernight2023) for you to run an instance of YOLOv8 on your PC (you are welcome!).

Hope to see you at the next SHARPER Night 2024... maybe with a robot dog on a leash!
